## Activity 3
A SQL database follows the relational model while a NoSQL database does not - a SQL database must consists of tables (each with a primary key).
Instead of tables, NoSQL databases often use collections. 
SQL databases are better when performing multi-row transaction (e.g. for the role example in the text, having a separate table for roles makes it easier to change role names), avoids duplication but can be less efficient when querying (since tables must be joined).
NoSQL databases's duplication allows faster querying. However it is less consistent compared to SQL databases.
